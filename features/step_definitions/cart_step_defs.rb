You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given("that I am on the t-shirt item page") do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

When("I click on the add to cart button") do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

When("I click on the proceed to checkout button") do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Then("I will go to the checkout page") do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

When("I click on the return to shopping button") do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Then("I will go back to the t-shirt item page") do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end
